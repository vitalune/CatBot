# Inclusive Design and Equitable Writing Infrastructure

## Overview

This document outlines how our team facilitated a fair and equitable writing infrastructure throughout the development of the CatBot project. Our approach emphasized inclusive collaboration, accessibility considerations, and equitable distribution of work.

## Team Structure and Communication

### Transparent Communication
Our team maintained open and transparent communication through Discord, which served as our primary collaboration platform. Key practices included:

- **Clear Task Delegation**: Each team member received explicit, achievable assignments with reasonable deadlines
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Team members coordinated around personal schedules (e.g., accommodating IM games, work shifts, other coursework like the CS449 malloc project)
- **Mutual Support**: Team members offered assistance to one another (sharing old C assignments, offering collaboration on difficult projects)
- **Check-ins**: Regular status updates and availability checks ensured no one was left behind or overwhelmed

### Equitable Task Distribution

The project work was distributed fairly across team members:

**Amir (Project Lead)**
- Chatbot integration and backend development
- System prompt engineering
- Platform deployment (Hugging Face)
- Documentation coordination
- GitHub repository management

**Aidumb (Aiden)**
- UX design documentation (Empathy Maps, User Storyboards, User Group Cards)
- System prompt research and refinement
- Red team testing for vulnerabilities
- Training documentation
- CS1502 (Formal Methods) course material collection

**BigBlub (Shash)**
- Website development and frontend
- GitHub repository setup
- CS1530 (Software Engineering) course material collection
- Pull request management

**EymerIsland02 (David)**
- Process verification documentation
- LCJS1320 (Civil Rights Law) course material collection
- Accessibility testing

## Inclusive Design Principles

### Academic Integrity and Ethical Design

Our system prompts were carefully engineered to maintain academic integrity:

- **No Direct Answers**: CatBot guides students through problem-solving rather than providing completed work
- **Concept Explanation Focus**: Emphasis on understanding and reasoning development
- **Scope Limitation**: Only answers questions from provided course materials (CS1502, CS1530, LCJS1320, MATH0280)
- **Probing Questions**: Encourages critical thinking rather than passive answer-seeking

### Privacy and Safety Protections

Comprehensive red team testing (10 adversarial prompts) validated protections for:
- Model manipulation attempts
- Academic dishonesty requests
- Privacy violations
- Harmful technical requests
- Jailbreak vulnerabilities
- Mental health appropriateness

## Equitable Data Collection

### Course Material Diversity

The team collected materials from four distinct subject areas, representing diverse fields:

**CS1502 (Formal Methods in Computer Science)** - Aiden
- Primarily private Pitt course slides and materials
- 70%+ from non-publicly accessible sources

**CS1530 (Software Engineering)** - Shash
- Course-specific documentation and slides
- Shared via Google Drive to handle large file sizes

**LCJS1320 (Civil Rights Law)** - David
- Syllabus
- Four important court cases
- U.S. Constitution excerpts
- Materials directly from Canvas course files

**MATH0280 (Linear Algebra)** - (To be specified)
- Practice questions and course materials

### Material Collection Guidelines

To ensure fairness and relevance:
- **70%+ Private Pitt Material**: Ensured the bot had access to materials not available to non-Pitt students, providing genuine value
- **Up to 30% External Sources**: Allowed supplementary materials (e.g., Quizlet) that directly related to course content
- **Format Flexibility**: No specific format requirements (PDF, PNG, etc.) to reduce technical barriers
- **Reasonable Quantity**: 5-7 documents per person from ONE challenging class

## Collaborative Problem-Solving

### Overcoming Technical Barriers

When team members encountered obstacles, the group collaborated on solutions:

**File Size Issues:**
- Problem: BigBlub's files were too large for Discord
- Solution: Used Google Drive sharing with email coordination
- Result: Successful file transfer without data loss

**Download Link Confusion:**
- Problem: EymerIsland02 initially shared Canvas internal links
- Solution: Amir clarified need for actual downloaded files via Gmail
- Result: Clear communication about file format expectations

**Deadline Flexibility:**
- Problem: Multiple team members had competing academic priorities (CS449 malloc project, work schedules, IM games)
- Solution: Extended deadlines and offered late-night collaboration options
- Result: All team members completed their tasks without undue stress

### Synchronous Collaboration Offers

Amir offered multiple synchronous collaboration options:
- Group calls or individual sessions based on preference
- Flexible timing (late-night availability)
- Task-specific calls (30-minute focused sessions)

This approach accommodated different working styles and schedules while ensuring everyone received necessary support.

### Writing Infrastructure Tools

The team used accessible, free platforms:
- **Discord**: Primary communication (free, widely used, accessible)
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration (free, industry-standard)
- **Google Docs**: Shared UX documentation (free, real-time collaboration)
- **Hugging Face**: Chatbot deployment (free tier available, accessible interface)
- **Gmail**: File sharing fallback (free, universally accessible)

## Commitment to Fairness

### Equal Voice in Decision-Making

All team members had input on:
- UI/UX design (e.g., Aiden's suggestion to change icon to a cat)
- System prompt personality and tone
- Course material selection
- Testing criteria

### Recognition of Individual Contributions

Each team member's contributions are clearly documented:
- Specific course material attribution
- UX design credit
- Development role acknowledgment
- Documentation authorship

### Accommodating Life Circumstances

The team recognized and accommodated:
- Work schedules (David's shift work)
- Academic pressures (CS449 malloc project crunch)
- Extracurricular commitments (IM games)
- Different time zone/schedule preferences (late-night availability)

## Conclusion

By prioritizing these principles, we created not just an accessible tutoring chatbot, but also an inclusive development process that valued every team member's contributions and circumstances.
